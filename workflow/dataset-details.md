* The original counties spatial data layer is downloaded from the
  [Colorado Information Marketplace](https://data.colorado.gov/Transportation/Counties-in-Colorado/67vn-ijga)
  and converted to 7-digit GeoJSON to decrease file size and use more reasonable precision.
  The layer is from the Colorado Department of Transportation.
